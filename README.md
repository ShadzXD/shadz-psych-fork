My Psych Engine v1.0.4 Maintenance Fork.

Fork used for [Super Funkin' Galaxy](https://gamebanana.com/mods/444759) & VS Oshawott: Funkin' Beynd.

Features as of now:

- Moves texture-atlas library to flixel animate.
- Multiple Fixes to Sustains 
- Removal of Language Support.
- Removal of Title JSON.
- Bug fixes.
- Updates all libraries.
- Moves HUD to its own class.

I don't recommend using this fork as of now since its relatively buggy and unfinished.
